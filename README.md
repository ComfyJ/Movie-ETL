# Movie-ETL
# Overview of the project
The project aims to process and convert data from three different sources: Kaggle metadata, MovieLens ratings, and Wikipedia JSON data.
The ultimate goal is to perform data analysis or build a recommendation system based on this combined dataset.

# Data Sources:
Kaggle Metadata, MovieLens Ratings:
Wikipedia JSON Data, Data Retrieval:
Read Kaggle metadata, MovieLens ratings, and Wikipedia JSON data.
Data Cleaning and Transformation:
I Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Convert data into a consistent format (e.g., Pandas DataFrames).
Data Integration:
Combined the three datasets based on common keys to create a comprehensive dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
I explored data distributions, correlations, and patterns.
Identify outliers or interesting insights.

Recommendation System (Possible Objective):
Given the combined dataset, build a recommendation system.
Collaborative filtering or content-based approaches could be explored.
Recommend movies to users based on their preferences.

Challenges and Considerations:
Data Quality:
Ensuring data quality is crucial for accurate analysis.
Handled inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers.
